Need it to read from a master table of habits that have a counter of occurrences in the content passed.
Once counter reaches a large enough number it seems like a valuable habit and then should be checked against my ethics and desires to see if they can add value to achieving my goals and other habits. If it aligns with me with a high enough confidence level then it should be added to my core habits table. 
Make sure to check the habit labels in the table so as  not to repeat a similar habit over again when adding to the counters. 

The type of content passed will be transcripts of videos, articles and blogs, books. 

The topics of interest are to improve my quality of life and focus on generating secondary passive income. There should also be a top 5 ideas section that may be untapped yet or have high potential. Give an effort score and resource (time, money, etc) investment estimate.
